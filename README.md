Analyzing-Boston-Housing-Data

I'm excited to share my recent project where I analyzed the Boston Housing dataset using Python and performed a comprehensive data analysis and built a linear regression model. 🏘️💻

I utilized powerful libraries like pandas, numpy, seaborn, and matplotlib for data manipulation, visualization, and statistical analysis. After loading the dataset, I conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA), checked for missing values, and visualized the distribution of the target variable, 'medv'. The insights gained from EDA were invaluable. 📊🔍

To prepare the data for modeling, I transformed categorical variables into numerical form using dummy encoding. Then, I split the dataset into training and testing sets and trained a linear regression model using scikit-learn. The model's performance was evaluated using the mean squared error, providing valuable insights into its predictive capabilities. 📈📉

To delve deeper into the regression analysis, I utilized the statsmodels library and fit an ordinary least squares (OLS) model. The summary provided by the library allowed me to gain deeper insights into the relationships between the variables. 📚🔬

Lastly, I visualized the relationship between 'age' and 'medv' using Plotly Express and Plotly Graph Objects. The scatter plot with the best-fit line showcased the trend between the variables, adding a visual dimension to the analysis. 📊🌐

This project was an incredible opportunity to apply my data analysis and machine learning skills, providing valuable insights into the Boston Housing dataset. 🧠💡

I'm thrilled to share my journey and the learnings I gained from this project. Stay tuned for more exciting updates! ✨
